Our male colleagues play a central role in breaking the glass ceiling, collectively and individually, once and for all. Catalystâ€™s study points out that in 2012, though women comprised over a third of the
workforce in the United States, they held a mere 14.3 percent of executive officer positions at Fortune 500 companies and
only 8 percent of executive officer top-earner positions.

To increase these numbers, men must sponsor us, open doors for us, and they must step up to the plate in bold, perhaps risky ways. Not just because we face gender barriers, but because women have exceptional leadership potential that will launch business operations to new levels.

This panel discussion includes successful male executives who have leveraged social capital with each other to attain executive positions. It addresses the role of men as allies in cultivating and nurturing female talent in the workplace.
