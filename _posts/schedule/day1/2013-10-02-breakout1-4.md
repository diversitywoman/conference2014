In today’s society, retirement at 62 years of age means for most of us – “MY next journey”. Women in the U.S. live healthier and extra- long lives 8% longer than men, and these “bonus” years may be a blessing of extra living. So the day you retire, how do you envision spending your immediate years, or perhaps next 15 years? What blind spots should you look for as you seek out potential opportunities?

Explore ways you can approach your resources in preparing the very beginning of your next move. Join Carmen Ortiz-McGhee’s workshop and learn how to utilize your valuable hard and soft skills, executive presence, your deep network and empower yourself starting a new chapter, perhaps as becoming the CEO of your own company.
