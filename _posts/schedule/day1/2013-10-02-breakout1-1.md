This workshop is focused on college students who will be volunteering and making this year’s conference happen.

Participants will learn how to build their personal brand. It is not so much what people say about you when you are in the room, but rather what they say about you when you are not in the room. The big decisions in anyone’s career are almost always made when the individual is not in the room. 

Participants will then move into networking exercises and learn first hand how to build a personal network, and how it is a big game-changer in one’s career. Combined with a big dose of inspiration and motivation students will learn how to make this coming semester the best of their academic career.

**Introduction:**

- Latoria J. Farmer, Executive Director Of Diversity & Corporate Responsibility, KPMG

- Charmane S. Johnson, Director, DoD Policy for Affirmative Employment Programs, U.S. Department of Defense

**Presenter:** Alan J. McMillan / Founder / LearnEarnRetire
