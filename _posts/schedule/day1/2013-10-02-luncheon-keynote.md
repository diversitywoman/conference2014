Join our keynote to glean ideas on how we can leverage all forms of 
inspiration to enhance our lives and, more importantly, how we can 
pay it forward to benefit the lives of others. As rising women leaders, 
we know that positivity is a key ingredient to surpass barriers, both 
at work and at home. Indeed, positivity not only increases workplace 
satisfaction, it also benefits workplace outcomes. Examine 
techniques how to channel it in a way that impacts ourselves and 
the world we live and work in. What is the best way for YOU to pay it 
forward? Sponsored by American Heart Association
