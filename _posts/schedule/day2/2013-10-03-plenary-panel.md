The future is NOW. Empowering girls and young women early on is key to positioning them for C-Suite positions. An education focused on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), for example, better prepares girls for the careers and mindset that translate into executive jobs. Indeed, over the past decade, growth in STEM jobs was three times as fast as growth in non-STEM jobs (Girlstart). What else can we do NOW to help develop and shape the leadership capacities of our young, rising female stars? What can teachers, parents, mentors and coaches do to bring out their strongest potential? What is the most successful education track for them to take to become a CEO?

Join a panel of experts for an in-depth look at techniques and strategies that we can employ with our young girls and women to prepare them for success in the corner office.
