Candi Castleberry-Singleton is the Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer at UPMC, a $10 billion, 20-hospital global health system and health plan. She is responsible for developing UPMC’s inclusion strategy, including its Dignity & Respect Campaign and Cultural Competency Initiative, as well for overseeing progress toward system-wide goals involving 55,000 employees. In 2008, she launched the UPMC Center for Inclusion.
An experienced strategist, Candi created The Integrated Inclusion Model, a systems integration model that helps companies transition from compliance-driven processes led by human resources, to integrated activities that shift the responsibility for achieving an inclusive culture to every employee. The model is featured in Crossing the Divide: Intergroup Leadership in a World of Difference (Harvard Business School Press, August 2009). Her inclusion initiatives have been implemented at Motorola, where she was Vice President of Global Inclusion and Diversity, and at Sun Microsystems, where she led the Global Inclusion Center of Expertise. 
Business acumen enhances Candi’s approach to inclusion. At Sun Microsystems, she led teams in operations and employee development, and she acquired extensive experience in sales, product marketing, training, and account management at Xerox Corporation. 
Candi received an MBA from Pepperdine University, a bachelor’s degree in legal studies from UC Berkeley, and graduated from the Stanford University Human Resources Executive Program.  She has received numerous sales, customer satisfaction, and diversity leadership awards. Most recently, Candi was named one of the 2012 Top 100 Influential Blacks in Corporate America by Savoy Magazine.
