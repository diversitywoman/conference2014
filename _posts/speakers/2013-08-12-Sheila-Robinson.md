Sheila A. Robinson, is the Founder and Publisher of Career Network magazine, a regional publication that provides ideas, solutions and resources to business professionals at all levels. Due to the overwhelming national response from diverse and multicultural women leaders, the publication expanded nationally in April of 2008 becoming Diversity Woman, a professional business magazine for women leaders, executives and entrepreneurs.

As a former Marketing Director in DuPont’s global textiles division over North America, Sheila was responsible for all Marketing Communications and Public Relations functions for its apparel business, including advertising, media relations, crisis management, retail promotions and trend and sales presentations. Sheila traveled throughout Europe and the Americas tracking and identifying the apparel trends shown at industry events and fashion shows including Essence magazine’s annual Essence Awards, GQ magazine’s “Man of the Year” awards, and 7th on 6th Fashion Shows with leading designers Zac Posen, Kenneth Cole and Escada.

After 14 years with DuPont, her division was sold. Faced with relocation, Sheila resigned from the company and started a publication she wished she had when she first launched her career - a publication that would help individuals experiencing the obstacles and challenges she endured throughout her career as an African-American woman. After finding success with her first publication, Sheila decided to establish Diversity Woman magazine. With its tagline “Leadership Empowerment for Women Who Mean Business,” the magazine is a thought- provoking and entertaining resource for female leaders, executives and entrepreneurs of all races and backgrounds – and is the only magazine geared specifically toward this sizeable demographic.

Sheila was the keynote speaker at the 2008 wives luncheon at the NFL Pro Bowl in Hawaii and speaks at numerous schools, conventions, universities and professional associations such as Women on Wall Street, Bennett College for Women, and the Johnnetta B. Cole Global Diversity Institute. She is a member of several organizations such as NAFE, (National Association for Female Executives) and NAWBO, (National Association for Women Business Owners). She serves on the board of directors of WIPP, (Women in Periodical Publishing) and BPW, (Business and Professional Women). She is a member and chapter publicist for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, a private, non-profit organization whose purpose is to provide services and programs to promote human welfare. She is the founder of the non-profit organization Iamaleader.org (The IAAL Foundation), a program that teaches leadership skills and provides resources about careers and entrepreneurship for students
in K-12.

Sheila is a graduate of the North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. She is a graduate of both the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce and The State of North Carolina Leadership Classes. She completed Stanford University’ Professional Publishing Program in 2007.   In 2011 She received her Masters of Entrepreneurship and Innovation from Western Carolina University, chosen by the School of Business faculty as the Top Student in her class.  That same year she was elected as The Greensboro Chamber of Commerce Minority Business Leader of the Year.  Sheila is currently a candidate for an executive Chief Learning Officer doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania.

Sheila is the recipient of the 2009 Image Award for her achievements and as a positive role model for young women, an award given out annually by the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference on behalf of historical black colleges and universities, sponsored by Colgate & Fashion Fair Cosmetics. She was
also named to Publishing Executive Magazine’s list of 50 Top Women in Magazine Publishing for the significant contribution she has made in the industry.
